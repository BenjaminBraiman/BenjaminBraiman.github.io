            <p>My name is Benjamin Braiman. 
                I am currently a fourth year undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. 
                I will graduate in May 2025 with an honors degree in mathematics and computer science.
                I am writing a senior honors thesis in probability theory under the guidance of Professor Sebastien Roch.
            </p>

            <p>
            Starting August 2025, I will be a PhD student in the department of mathematics at UC Berkeley. 
            </p>

        <h3>Notes</h3>
            These are some personal notes on mathematical topics which currently or have interested me in the past. All of these notes should be treated as works in progress.
            As such there may be inaccuracies, so these should not be a substitute
            for more "official" sources.

        <h3>Other Mathematical Writings</h3>
            These are solutions to selected exercises and problems I have worked on as an undergraduate. Many come from textbooks or other sources,
            but some are of my own making. 
        
            All this work should be treated as a "work in progress," so expect at least a few mistakes here and there.
