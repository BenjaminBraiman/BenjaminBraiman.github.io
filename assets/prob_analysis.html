  <h2>First Post: A "Probabalistic" Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</h2>
  <p class="meta">July 18, 2025</p>
  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) famously states that non-constant polynomial \(a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1z + a_0\) where \(a_0,\dots,a_n \in \mathbb{C}\) has exactly \(n\) complex roots, counting multiplicity. There are several proofs of this fact. Most of the simple ones that are taught during undergraduate involve
    complex analysis in one shape or form. 
    
    One such proof (which can even be found on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra#Complex-analytic_proofs> Wikipedia</a>) invokes Liouville's theorem:

    <div class="math-block" id="thm: Liouville">
      <div class="label">Theorem 1.1 (Liouville's Theorem)</div>
      <p>
       If \(f : \mathbb C \to \mathbb C\) is a bounded entire function, then \(f\) is constant.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    Assuming Liouville's theorem, FTA follows rather cleanly through a contradiction argument.  If there is a nonconstnat polynomial \(p(z) = a_nz^n + \cdots + a_0\) with no zeros
    in \(\mathbb C\) (of course, \(a_n \neq 0\)), then \(1/p\) is holomorphic and entire. Since \(|p|\) grows like \(|a_n z^n|\) as \(|z| \to \infty\) we see that \(1/p(z) \to 0\) as \(|z| \to \infty\), 
    so \(1/p\) is also bounded and thus constant by Liouville's theorem. This is a contradiction, which is resolved by admitting each polynomial \(p\) has a root in \(\mathbb C\). That there are \(n\) such roots counting
    multiplicity follows now from an easy induction argument involving the division algorithm for polynomials.

    
    <p>
      While this proof is disarmingly simple, we have so far assumed Liouville's theorem without proof. It turns out that we can give a probabalistic proof of Liouville's theorem, and hence a "probabalistic" proof of FTA.

      To prevent this article from turning into a textbook, I assume that the reader is familiar with Brownian motion and basic results in stochastic analysis, such as Ito's lemma. (For some basic results, review <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion#Mathematics">this Wikipedia article</a>, or if you have more time, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-14394-6">this textbook on SDE</a> ).
    </p>

    <p>
      The key to this argument are the following two lemmas, both of which are essentially standard:
    </p>

    <div class="math-block" id="lemma: harmonic-martingale">
      <div class="label">Lemma 1.2</div>
      <p>
       Suppose that \(f : \mathbb C \to \mathbb C\) is a holomorphic function. If \(B_t\) is a standard Brownian motion in \(\mathbb C\), then \(f(B_t)\) is a martingale.
      </p>
    </div>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Proof</b></summary>
      <p>
        Applying Ito's lemma to both the real and imaginary parts of \(f\) and using the fact both functions are harmonic, we see
    \[f(B_t) = f(B_0) + \int_0^t \nabla f(B_s)\cdot dB_s,\] 
    where the gradient is applied component wise the the real and imaginary parts of \(f\), which are viewed as functions on \(\mathbb R^2\). Since the Ito integral is a martingale, the conclusion follows.
      </p>
    </details>

    <div class="math-block" id="lemma: stopping-time">
      <div class="label">Lemma 1.3</div>
      <p>
       Suppose that \(B_t\) is a complex Brownian motion started at \(B_0 = z\). For each \(r > 0\), let \(T_r\) be the stopping time \(T_r := \inf\{t \geq 0 : |B_t| = r\}\). Then \(T_r < +\infty\) a.s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Proof</b></summary>
      <p>
        Exercise.
      </p>
    </details>

    

    
    <!-- Since the function \(z\mapsto \log|z|\) is harmonic on \(\{z \neq 0\}\), the proof of <a href="#lemma: harmonic-martingale">Lemma 1.2</a> shows that \(\log|B_t|\) is a martingale. Fix \(R > r\) and let \(T = T_R \land T_r\). Since \(\log|B_{T\land t}|\) is also a martingale,
    \[\mathbb{E}_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \log |f(z)|.\]
    On the other hand,
   \[\mathbb{E}_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \]  -->
  </p>

  <p>
    With these two simple lemmas, we can prove Liouville's theorem:
    <div class="math-block" id="proof: Liouville proof">
      <div class="label">Proof of Lioville's Theorem</div>
      <p>
        Suppose that \(f\) is a bounded entire function. We can assume that \(f(0) = 0\). Let \(M > 0\) be chosen so that \(|f(z)| \leq M\) for all \(z\in \mathbb C\).


        Let \(B_t\) be a standard Brownian motion started at a point \(z\neq 0\). Since \(f\) is an entire function, it holds \(f(B_t)\) is a complex martingale. Fix \(\epsilon > 0\), and let \(\delta > 0\) be small enough that \(|f(z)| \leq \epsilon\) if \(|z| \leq \delta\). By shrinking \(\delta\) if necessary, we can assume \(\delta < |z|\). Let \(T_\delta\) be as in Lemma <a href="lemma: stopping-time">1.3</a>. Then \(f(B_{T_\delta \land t})\) is a martingale. We know that \(T_\delta < \infty\) a.s. Since \(f(B_{T_\delta \land t})\) is uniformly bounded and continuous as a function of \(t\), we can apply dominated convergence to get
        \[\mathbb{E}_z[f(B_{T_\delta})] = \lim_{t \to \infty}\mathbb{E}_z[f(B_{T_\delta \land t})] = f(z).\]
        However, since \(|B_{T_\delta}| \leq \delta\), we see that \(|f(B_{T_\delta})| \leq \epsilon\), so
        \[|f(z)| \leq \mathbb{E}_z[|f(B_{T_\delta})|] \leq \epsilon.\]
        Since \(\epsilon > 0\) was arbitrary, it follows \(f(z) = 0\) for all \(z\in \mathbb C\), and we are done.
      </p>
    </div>


  Thus we have a "probabalistic" proof of Liouville's theorem. While there is significant stochastic analysis required to fully understand the proof, a closer inspection of this proof actually shows that this method can completely bypass the need for Cauchy's integral formula 
  to prove FTA. While Cauchy's formula is typically used to prove holomorphic functions are \(C^\infty\), thus justifying the application of Ito's lemma in <a href="lemma: harmonic-martingale">Lemma 1.2</a>, for the motive of proving FTA this can actually be assumed without proof since polynomials are trivially \(C^\infty\). 
  </p>

  <p>
    As a further application of this method, can you prove the maximum modulus principle using stochastic analysis? Or can you prove Liouville's theorem for a holomorphic function of several complex variables using this argument?

<!--   <h2>Post 2: Ergodic Bites</h2>
  <p class="meta">July 20, 2025</p>
  <p>
    In preparing for a course in Markov chains, I encountered a disarmingly simple characterization of ergodicity in terms of total variation convergence. It reminded me of a line from Kac: “A mathematician is a person who does not fear the infinite.” More soon.
