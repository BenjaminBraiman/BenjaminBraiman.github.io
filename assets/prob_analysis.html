  <h2>First Post: A "Probabalistic" Proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra</h2>
  <p class="meta">July 18, 2025</p>
  <p>
    The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) famously states that non-constant polynomial \(a_n z^n + \cdots + a_1z + a_0\) where \(a_0,\dots,a_n \in \mathbb{C}\) has exactly \(n\) complex roots, counting multiplicity. Most simple proofs that are taught during undergraduate involve
    complex analysis in one shape or form. For example this argument (which can be found on <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra#Complex-analytic_proofs> Wikipedia</a>) invokes Liouville's theorem:

    <div class="math-block" id="thm: Liouville">
      <div class="label">Theorem 1.1 (Liouville's Theorem)</div>
      <p>
       If \(f : \mathbb C \to \mathbb C\) is a bounded entire function, then \(f\) is constant.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    Assuming Liouville's theorem, FTA follows rather cleanly through a contradiction argument.  If there is a non-constant polynomial \(p(z) = a_nz^n + \cdots + a_0\) with no zeros
    in \(\mathbb C\) (of course, \(a_n \neq 0\)), then \(1/p\) is holomorphic and entire. Since \(|p(z)|\) grows like \(|a_n z^n|\) for large \(z\), we see that \(1/p(z) \to 0\) as \(|z| \to \infty\).
    This proves \(1/p\) is bounded and thus constant by Liouville's theorem. This contradiction is resolved by admitting each polynomial \(p\) has a root in \(\mathbb C\). That there are \(n\) such roots counting
    multiplicity follows now from an easy induction argument involving the polynomial division algorithm.

    
    <p>
      One idea behind a "probabalistic" proof of the FTA is to somehow use probability to prove Liouville's theorem, from which FTA follows readily. 

      To prevent this article from turning into a textbook, I assume that the reader is familiar with Brownian motion and basic results in stochastic analysis, such as Ito&#770's lemma. (For the basics, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion#Mathematics">this Wikipedia article</a>, or for the patient, <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-14394-6">this textbook on SDE</a> .)
    </p>

    <p>
      The key to this argument are the following two lemmas, both of which are essentially standard:
    </p>

    <div class="math-block" id="lemma: harmonic-martingale">
      <div class="label">Lemma 1.2</div>
      <p>
       Suppose that \(f : \mathbb C \to \mathbb C\) is a holomorphic function. If \(B_t\) is a standard Brownian motion in \(\mathbb C\), then \(f(B_t)\) is a martingale.
      </p>
    </div>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Proof</b></summary>
      <p>
        Applying Ito's lemma to both the real and imaginary parts of \(f\) and using the fact both functions are harmonic, we see
    \[f(B_t) = f(B_0) + \int_0^t \nabla f(B_s)\cdot dB_s,\] 
    where the gradient is applied component wise the the real and imaginary parts of \(f\), which are viewed as functions on \(\mathbb R^2\). Since the Ito integral is a martingale, the conclusion follows.
      </p>
    </details>

    <div class="math-block" id="lemma: stopping-time">
      <div class="label">Lemma 1.3</div>
      <p>
       Suppose that \(B_t\) is a complex Brownian motion started at \(B_0 = z\). For each \(r > 0\), define a stopping time \(T_r := \inf\{t \geq 0 : |B_t| = r\}\). Then \(T_r < +\infty\) a.s.
      </p>
    </div>
    <details>
      <summary><b>Proof</b></summary>
      <p>
        We can assume that \(r < |z|\). Fix \(R > |z|\) and put \(T = T_R \land T_r\). Note that \(T < \infty\) a.s, since otherwise \(|B_t| \leq R\) for all \(t\geq 0\), which is impossible since
       \[\mathbb{P}_z[|B_t| \leq R\text{ for all }t \geq 0] \leq \lim_{t \to \infty}\frac{1}{2\pi t}\int_{|z| \leq R}\exp\left(-\frac{|x - z|^2}{2t}\right)\, dx = 0.\] 
        
        Since \(\log|B_{T \land t}|\) is a martingale, 
        \[\mathbb E_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \log|z|.\]
       Using the fact \(|B_{T \land t}| \leq R\) for all \(t \geq 0\), dominated convergence yields
       \[\lim_{t \to \infty}\mathbb E_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \mathbb E_z[\log|B_T|] =  \mathbb P_z[T_R < T_r]\log R + \mathbb P_z[T_r < T_R]\log r.\]
       Since \[ \mathbb{P}_z[T_R \geq t] \leq \frac{1}{2\pi t}\int_{|z| \leq R}\exp\left(-\frac{|x - z|^2}{2t}\right)\, dx,\] 
       taking \(R \to \infty\) and then \(t \to \infty\) shows that \(T_R \nearrow \infty\) as \(R \to \infty\). So, if \(\mathbb P_z[T_r = \infty] > 0\), then
      \[\lim_{R \to \infty}\log|z| =  \lim_{R \to \infty} \mathbb P_z[T_R < T_r]\log R + \mathbb P_z[T_r < T_R]\log r = \infty .\] 
      To avoid contradiction, \(\mathbb P_z[T_r < \infty] = 1\).
      </p>
    </details>

    

    
    <!-- Since the function \(z\mapsto \log|z|\) is harmonic on \(\{z \neq 0\}\), the proof of <a href="#lemma: harmonic-martingale">Lemma 1.2</a> shows that \(\log|B_t|\) is a martingale. Fix \(R > r\) and let \(T = T_R \land T_r\). Since \(\log|B_{T\land t}|\) is also a martingale,
    \[\mathbb{E}_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \log |f(z)|.\]
    On the other hand,
   \[\mathbb{E}_z[\log|B_{T \land t}|] = \]  -->
  </p>

  <p>
    These two lemmas can prove Liouville's theorem:
    <div class="math-block" id="proof: Liouville proof">
      <div class="label">Proof of Liouville's Theorem</div>
      <p>
        Suppose that \(f\) is a bounded entire function. We can assume that \(f(0) = 0\). Let \(M > 0\) be chosen so that \(|f(z)| \leq M\) for all \(z\in \mathbb C\).


        Let \(B_t\) be a standard Brownian motion started at a point \(z\neq 0\). Since \(f\) is an entire function, it holds \(f(B_t)\) is a complex martingale. Fix \(\epsilon > 0\), and let \(\delta > 0\) be small enough that \(|f(z)| \leq \epsilon\) if \(|z| \leq \delta\). By shrinking \(\delta\) if necessary, we can assume \(\delta < |z|\). Let \(T_\delta\) be as in Lemma <a href="lemma: stopping-time">1.3</a>. Then \(f(B_{T_\delta \land t})\) is a martingale. We know that \(T_\delta < \infty\) a.s. Since \(f(B_{T_\delta \land t})\) is uniformly bounded and continuous as a function of \(t\), we can apply dominated convergence to get
        \[\mathbb{E}_z[f(B_{T_\delta})] = \lim_{t \to \infty}\mathbb{E}_z[f(B_{T_\delta \land t})] = f(z).\]
        However, since \(|B_{T_\delta}| \leq \delta\), we see that \(|f(B_{T_\delta})| \leq \epsilon\), so
        \[|f(z)| \leq \mathbb{E}_z[|f(B_{T_\delta})|] \leq \epsilon.\]
        Since \(\epsilon > 0\) was arbitrary, it follows \(f(z) = 0\) for all \(z\in \mathbb C\), and we are done.
      </p>
    </div>


  Thus we have a "probabalistic" proof of Liouville's theorem. A closer inspection of the argument actually shows we can bypass the need to prove Cauchy's integral formula 
  before FTA, which is unusual among complex analysis proofs. While Cauchy's formula is often used to prove holomorphic functions are \(C^\infty\) (justifying the application of Ito&#770's lemma in <a href="lemma: harmonic-martingale">Lemma 1.2</a>), for the purpose of proving FTA we do not need to prove this since polynomials are trivially \(C^\infty\). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Clearly, this approach is overkill, since formalizing the stochastic analysis requires functional analysis and measure theory. Regardless, I found it interesting revisit this classic theorem with probabalistic tools.
    Here are a few parting exercises:
    <ul>
      <li><b>1</b>. Consider the following simplification of Liouville's theorem: Let \(f : \mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb R\) be a function such that 
        \[
          f(m,n) = \frac{f(n+1,m) + f(n,m+1) + f(n,m-1) + f(n-1,m)}{4}
        \] 
      for all \(m,n\). Show that \(f\) is bounded iff it is constant. (Hint: Let \(S_k\) be a simple random walk in \(\mathbb Z^2\) started at \((m,n)\). Show \(f(S_k)\) is a martingale.)</li>
      <li><b>2</b>. Use stochastic analysis to prove the maximum modulus principle. If you are unfamiliar with stochastic analysis (or complex analysis), show that if \(S \subset \mathbb Z^2\), then any function \(f\) as in Exercise 1 achieves its maximum on \(S\) at a boundary point of \(S\). Here, the boundary of \(S\) is defined as the set of points in \((n,m) \in S\) such that at least one of the points \((n+1,m), (n,m+1), (n-1,m),(n,m-1)\) is not in \(S\).
      </li>
      <li><b>3</b>. Can this method be used to prove Liouville's theorem for functions of several complex variables?</li>
    </ul> 
  </p>

  <p class="meta">July 20, 2025</p>
  <p>
    In preparing for a course in Markov chains, I encountered a disarmingly simple characterization of ergodicity in terms of total variation convergence. It reminded me of a line from Kac: “A mathematician is a person who does not fear the infinite.” More soon.
